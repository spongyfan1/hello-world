    <p> Hey everyone, here's a quick little website I made, mainly to have a website to link on my Facebook profile. Here, I hope to put my pictures, some coding projects, and more stuff. I wrote this myself without any templates or website makers or anything, so that's why it looks so simple. This is also a work in progress, so it doesn't have everything I want to on it--yet.</p>
