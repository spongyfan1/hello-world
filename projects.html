    <h2> Hello World! (what you're on right now)</h2>
    <p> Currently my only coding project that's in progress right now. Written with Sublime Text on my Mac Mini and uploaded with GitHub and GitHub Pages.</p>
    <h2> Jailbreaking my phone (does this count as a project that I can put on here?) </h2>
    <p> So one day I figured out that my phone was compatible with jailbreaking, so I jailbroke it and here it is. It's an iPhone SE (1st gen) on iOS 15.7.4 jailbroken with palera1n.</p>
    <p> Here's what my lock/home screen looks like currently:</p>
    <img id="jbimg" src="images/IMG_0551.PNG" alt="Lock screen" />
    <img id="jbimg" src="images/IMG_0552.PNG" alt="Home screen" />
  </body>
